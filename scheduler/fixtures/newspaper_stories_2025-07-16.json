In March 2024, international donors delivered boxes of emergency food to his village, Hatam Khail, but the Afghan capital and surrounding areas remain blighted by decades of war and out of basic services. As they waited for snow to melt around their mud brick house and for their cherry tree to blossom, Usman, his wife, and their six sons and grandchildren carefully rationed the donated goods. They expected more food would come during the winter but it never did. Usman, holding out hands cracked by years of hard labor, said that the Taliban-run regime provided nothing. During America’s 20-year war against the Taliban, successive U.S. presidents vowed never to abandon Afghanistan, one of the world’s poorest and most underdeveloped nations. When American troops withdrew in 2021 and the Taliban regained power, the United States remained the country’s largest humanitarian donor, accounting for more than 40 percent of all humanitarian support—helping stave off hunger and support health care providers. That lifeline and but vanished when Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, swiftly announcing a pause in foreign assistance programs that he said were \"not aligned with American interests and in many cases\" were effectively discontinued.","sentiment":"negative","people":["Muhammad Usman","Taliban","Donald Trump"],"categories":["Afghanistan","Aid","International"]},{"id":12274,"headline":"Falling under AI’s aegis: War and taxes","summary":"Elon Musk has receded from Washington but one of his most disruptive ideas about government is surging inside the Trump administration. Artificial intelligence, Musk has said, can do a better job than federal employees at many tasks — a notion being tested by AI projects trying to automate work across nearly every agency in the executive branch. The Federal Aviation Administration is exploring whether AI can be a better air traffic controller. The Pentagon is using AI to help officers distinguish between combatants and civilians in the field, and said Monday that its personnel would begin using the chatbot Grok offered by Musk’s start-up xAI, which is trying to gain a foothold in federal agencies. A central role could soon play a central role in tax audits, airport security screenings and more, according to public documents and interviews with current and former federal workers. Many of these AI programs aim to shrink the federal workforce — continuing the work of Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, which has cut thousands of government employees. Government AI is also promised to reduce wait times and lower costs to American taxpayers.

Families appear to be pulling back on travel spending, after years of splurging on vacations and other experiences after the pandemic-era shutdowns. Travel households are booking airline tickets or hotel rooms now than they were a year ago. Bank of America data shows the number of people taking vacation time off work in June dropped to its lowest level since the pandemic, according to Labor Department data. There are growing worries about the economy — with new trade and immigration policies taking hold. Many are bracing for a spike in prices from new tariffs, while others are worried about losing their jobs in a slowing labor market. Renewed tariff threats last week — including rates as high as 50 percent on goods from Brazil, Japan and Canada starting August 9 — have added to fears that a new round of inflation may be around the corner. Consumer spending dropped in May, as households put more of their incomes in savings in anticipation of higher costs. In all, Americans expect to spend an average $3,132 on summer vacations this year, about 25 percent less than the $4,199 they set aside last summer, according to an annual survey conducted by Ipsos for Generali Global Assistance. The spending slowdown is real, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. Consumers are stressed, and this is where we’re seeing it first: in domestic flights, hotels, and a lot of other service-sector spending. Although the wealthiest Americans are still splurging on international travel and booking hotel rooms that cost $800 a night or more, average consumers are cutting back significantly on vacations to manage costs.
