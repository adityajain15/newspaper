After hearing arguments on an emergency request from D.C. officials to block the Trump administration's takeover of the city's 3,100-member police department, U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes forged a compromise of sorts between the two sides — without issuing a ruling — on the key question of who runs the police force. She indicated D.C. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith has to remain in charge. The court did not rule on another crucial question: whether Trump can commandeer D.C. police officers to enforce immigration laws. That issue is likely to be resolved next week, Reyes said — but the Trump administration probably would be able to require help on immigration matters from local officers. The D.C. government could once again face a dilemma: comply with the Trump administration's efforts to enforce immigration law, despite District laws and policies preventing police from doing so, or resist and further inflame one of the greatest conflicts in the half-century history of the city's home rule.
